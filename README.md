# **_Unix-Final-Project_**

## Project description and goals

        We are aiming to achieve a secure and fast online web server for all users to help providing a good service. Our online server will contain many useful                 websites to help our users the best we can. The best way to get our server running will be by purchasing a VPS and using that. This will also help with our             security for our web server.

## Platform of choice
        For the platform, we decided to go with OVHcloud over DigitalOcean. Each VPS has their own qualities, but OVH is a better deal. OVHcloud virtual private server         is good because it has a decent price and offers a better protection than other. The main pros and cons between OVHcloud and DigitalOcean are shown in the              picture below. 

## Requirements
  Creation of user accounts: We will create our own account for our VPS but when it comes to multiple user accounts we are not to sure if we will need to implement       this yet. 

   Service management: We will be monitoring our server everyday to make sure everything is working efficiently and making sure that the websites are accessible. 

   Basic system security: since we have a VPS the system security will be much easier to deal with. We will first choose a hosting provider that prioritizes security,    we will then try and set up a firewall using IP tables. 

   Automated tasks using scripted language: At this moment we do not have any use for automated tasks but once we start building our web server, we will surely create    some.
